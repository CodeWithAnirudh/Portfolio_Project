# COVID-19 Analysis Using SQL  

## 📌 Project Overview  
This project analyzes COVID-19 data using **SQL** to gain insights into case trends, mortality rates, vaccination progress, and country-wise statistics. The analysis is performed using **MySQL** and includes key SQL concepts such as **JOINs, CTEs, Window Functions, and Views**.

## 📊 Dataset Used  
- **COVID-19 Cases Data** – Contains information on total cases, new cases, total deaths, and population by country.  
- **COVID-19 Vaccination Data** – Contains details on vaccination numbers per country.  

## 🔍 Key SQL Queries & Insights  
- **Total Cases vs Total Deaths** – Analyzes death percentages across different countries.  
- **Infection Rate Comparison** – Identifies the most affected countries based on population.  
- **Highest Death Counts by Country & Continent** – Shows where COVID-19 had the highest impact.  
- **Global Summary** – Aggregates total cases, deaths, and calculates overall death percentage.  
- **Vaccination Analysis** – Examines vaccination progress over time using **JOINs, PARTITION BY, CTEs, and Views**.  

## 🚀 How to Use  
1. **Download the SQL file** (`Covid_Analysis_Project.sql`).  
2. **Import the dataset** into **MySQL Workbench** or any SQL environment.  
3. **Run the queries** to explore different COVID-19 insights.
